# Pod YAML file for building Pod

This is the file which kubernetes uses to build a pod

A pod is what runs 1 or more containers inside

the service will be connected to the pod and thats how the program runs

The following command is the one i used to build the pod.yaml

- kubectl apply -f .\pod.yaml
