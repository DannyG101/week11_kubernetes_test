# Docker Branch for writing the docker file

Not sure what i am meant to write here

I wrote a Dockerfile so that i can build an image from tis app and then push it to Dockerhub

I ran the following to create and push

- ** docker build -t dannygoldberg/streamlit-app:v2 .

- **  docker push dannygoldberg/streamlit-app:v2
