# Docker Branch for writing the docker file

Not sure what i am meant to write here

I wrote a Dockerfile so that i can build an image from tis app and then push it to Dockerhub

a Docker file is where the Docker reads how to build an image

An image is wheremy app will be ran in a container and like that i can run a kubernetes program

I ran the following to create and push

- ** docker build -t dannygoldberg/streamlit-app:v2 .

- **  docker push dannygoldberg/streamlit-app:v2
